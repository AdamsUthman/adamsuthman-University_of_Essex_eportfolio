                                    <p><strong>WHAT?</strong></p>
									<p>
                                        This was the hardest module I have encountered so far in the course of my study. 
                                        Every week was different, with difficult course content, a quick pace, and most challenging for me, 
                                        the chance to collaborate with my course mates on a team project. I was intimidated by the idea of working in a team because I wasn’t used to it, 
                                        and I wasn’t sure I could contribute significantly seeing that several of my peers were more experienced than I was. However, 
                                        despite the different levels of experience, with the help of my teammates and by defining our roles and splitting the work, the project was a success.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Another challenge I faced was the fact that we were introduced to new concepts of software development, such as ontologies, cryptography, encryption, 
                                        and system architectures, with which I was not quite familiar. I also started this module without any prior experience in secure development but with 
                                        the motivation to take an extra step towards achieving my goal of becoming a software developer. This module’s first assignment required students to use 
                                        the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the SDLC phases to generate a design proposal. The outcome of the design proposal, along with the planning and requirements analysis phases, 
                                        were then used to create the final project. As a team, we created a secure repository that transmits data from the International Space Station (ISS) to the ground stations; we named it the ISS Data Archive (IDA).
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>SO WHAT?</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        At the beginning of the module, we established a team contract and assigned roles to one another. We then unanimously decided to make Trevor our team leader. 
                                        To carry out the module’s tasks and the unit’s elaboration, we created a group on Teams to be in constant communication. We also held team meetings, but not 
                                        too often due to the difference in time zones. Because we all had the same goal—graduating with honors—I wasn't shocked that our team could get along so well.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Despite my initial intimidation, as the team project developed, I discovered that it was a fulfilling and enjoyable experience. Each of us got the chance to not 
                                        only gain practical experience with technologies that support remote software development throughout the course of the project but also learn from each other. 
                                        Trevor, who has vast experience in software development, took the initiative, put the necessary tools in place, and also directed us in the right direction. 
                                        As someone who has always thought that learning from an industry practitioner is as important as reading and practicing, it was a great opportunity for me to 
                                        learn a few things from him. During our meeting, we drafted a design document template and also made some design decisions. Initially, we had our doubts about using 
                                        Flask as the web framework since it was suitable for micro services, but after some feedback from the tutor, we decided to continue with the plan.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Since we all agreed on using Flask for this project, I had to educate myself on the framework. In addition to the computer science course, 
                                        I spent over 20+ hours in a Flask online course (FreeCodeCamp, 2020) and also watched YouTube videos. I intended to finish the course quickly 
                                        so that I could contribute to the development of the project. I will admit that the weeks were challenging because I had to juggle a full-time job, 
                                        complete the units and coding exercises, and also try to catch up with the seminar recordings. Nevertheless, I am very proud of myself because I have 
                                        acquired the necessary skills that will help me not only write code for the team project but also help me in my journey of becoming a software developer.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Another crucial component of this module was the opportunity to put some of the theoretical lessons we learned in earlier modules into practice. 
                                        For example, we talked and read a lot about software testing and testing procedures in the previous module, and without actual experience, I was unable to understand the topic in depth. 
                                        Fortunately, this module provided literature on how testing may be done in Python (Pillai, 2017). I was able to use unittest in this module to create test cases for little programs 
                                        I built by following the examples in the book. This was really fulfilling for me as it was another step towards achieving my goal. Additionally, the forum discussions for this module 
                                        encouraged me to look out for relevant materials that were essential to my understanding of the principles of secure software design. For example, OWASP (OWASP, 2021) gave a thorough 
                                        overview of typical software vulnerabilities and preventive methods, which helped us strengthen our application against typical threats. Additional topics such as base-69 encryption and 
                                        microservices were particularly fascinating to learn about and helped me get a better understanding of how to develop secure software.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>NOW WHAT?</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now that I have completed my first team project, I feel rather comfortable working in a remote environment with people from different backgrounds. 
                                        This is an essential ability that employers nowadays are looking for, and it will help me land my first job as a software developer. I also feel 
                                        that if I can improve my skills in a few key areas, I will be able to work effectively as a member of a team. I believe that writing testable software 
                                        should be a standard in software development, and I intend to adopt the habit of including various types of testing even in the smallest piece of code in 
                                        order to become more comfortable creating test cases for complex pieces of software.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In summary, I believe that this module taught me a lot, especially while we were delivering the team project. I discovered that working in a team-based 
                                        atmosphere is where I have the happiest experiences. At the start of the course, I read that I would be capable of achieving success as a junior software 
                                        developer, programmer, or web developer. I would say my time during this course was a huge success, as I have acquired a lot of skills to prepare me for my 
                                        adventure into computer science. My next plan is to use all the skills I have acquired to build a project, learn more skills, and become a better software developer.

									<h2>Unit 1 -  INTRODUCTION TO SECURE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                                    <h3>My Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This unit's major objective was to compare agile techniques with a security focus on the Waterfall method. 
                                        These two methods adopt quite distinct postures in terms of security, documentation, and development speed. 
                                        With several concepts like S-Scrum (Mougouei, et al., 2013) or Secure Scrum, researchers have been seeking 
                                        to address the security gap while agile methodologies, particularly Scrum, appear to be disregarding it (Pohl & Hof, 2015). 
                                        Scrum is a reasonably well-known software development framework, therefore analyzing its security strategy is particularly relevant to the module and, generally, to the state of software development today.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The team also met during this unit and we had our first group meeting. We agreed on a team contract, and also set up a GitHub repository for the project.
                                        Being part of a remote development team will, in my opinion, be a thrilling experience given how popular remote working is today. It will also help me work on my communication skills.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Forum Discussion</h3>
                                    <p>Select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One of the top 10 vulnerabilities as identified by OWASP, is broken authentication (OWASP, 2021). A significant security risk might arise from improperly implemented authentication and session management calls. These flaws could make it simple for attackers to assume the identities of authorized users.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Due to users being careless with their passwords or using weak passwords, it makes it easier for hackers to get into their accounts and gain access to personal information. Enforcing strong password regulations and extra security measures, such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or one-time passwords (OTP), that ensure user compliance can help to reduce this.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        An activity diagram demonstrating how a hacker can access a user's account is provided below. Since there is no 2FA in place, the attacker has the freedom to attempt as many passwords as they like, beginning with a weaker one. It will be more difficult to log in with complex passwords, a restriction on the number of times an incorrect password can be entered, and 2FA in place.
                                    </p>

                                        <li>Scrum, pair programming, the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), and test-driven development are all components of the <strong>Agile Approach</strong> to software development. This method makes it simple to return to the software's earlier stage(s) if necessary.</li>
                                        <li>The <strong>Waterfall model </strong>is a step-by-step process where each phase is dependent on the results of the one before it. The cost of going back to an earlier phase of the project is high. As a result, it is unable to adapt to changing needs.</li>
                                        <li>Scrum prioritizes fast software development and deployment over a proper security perspective by design. Scrum's weakness can be reduced by risky solutions like <strong>S-Scrum or Secure Scrum</strong>.</li>
                                        <li>The general structure of a software system and the relationships between its components are more the focus of<strong> Architecture</strong>.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Testability</strong> is the scope of the ease/difficulty with which a system or software artifact can be tested.</li>

                                    <p>
                                        The main topic of conversation this week was various cyber security issues. 
                                        We continued our collaborative conversation regarding the OWASP's Top 10 security concerns, 
                                        and everyone agreed that the biggest security risk we currently face comes from people's negligence. 
                                        Many consumers appear to be completely unaware of the need of choosing a strong password, protecting their login information, 
                                        and adhering to fundamental security guidelines. 
                                    </p>

                                        <li>Because there are currently no Security Engineering processes established expressly for agile techniques, businesses must rely on SE processes created for the waterfall approach.</li>
                                        <li>It's crucial to think about the effects of applying the patch before installing the updates (e.g. downtime, effected components, etc.).</li>
                                        <li>The risk for program users grows when the individual or people who discover the issue distribute the exploit code publicly.</li>

                                    <p>
                                        While we read extensively and learned a lot about design patterns in the prior module, 
                                        this week's reading regarding the application of design patterns in Python was extremely intriguing and helpful. 
                                        Having a clear understanding of how things should be done helped me immensely because I plan to implement some pertinent design patterns into my future coding efforts. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We had two code-related activities this week. One of them gave an example of the memory management differences between C and Python. The producer-consumer mechanism was second one that was looked into.

                                    <h3>TEAM ACTIVITY: DISCUSSION</h3>
                                    <p><Strong>Question: What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</Strong></p>
                                    <p><Strong>Ans: </Strong> The three main programming language vulnerabilities, according to Cifuentes & Bierman (2019),
                                         are buffer errors, injection mistakes, and information leak flaws. No programming language is immune to all three of these errors, 
                                         as they showed in their research, hence there is no such thing as a "secure language."
                                    </p>
                                    <p><Strong>Question: Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</Strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Ans:</strong>
                                        Although having some more elegant memory management features than certain other languages, 
                                        Python is nonetheless prone to several security flaws, such as overflow issues and injection 
                                        attacks (especially in the case of web frameworks). As a result, Python cannot be regarded as a secure language.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><Strong>Question:  Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</Strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Ans:</strong>
                                        Python is a fantastic language that can be used for a number of reasons since it is a high-level language, 
                                        making it simpler to code. It also has substantial library support. It is slower, though, because it is an interpreted language. 
                                        Contrarily, C is a compiled language that gives greater flexibility in addition to being faster. It would be more appropriate to 
                                        design an operating system based on how it handles memory. C is therefore a superior language to use for developing an operating system.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>CODIO ACTIVITIES</h3>
                                    <p><strong>Exploring Python tools and features</strong></p>
                                    <p>Buffer overflow in C and Python:</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Buffer overflow in C: Using "char buf[8]," only a memory space for 8 characters was allocated in the RAM for user input. 
                                        So, we receive a "core dumped" error when a user enters an input with more than 8 characters.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>The Producer-Consumer Mechanism</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        1. How is the queue data structure used to achieve the purpose of the code?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The producer appends the data it creates to the queue data structure, which serves as a buffer where the consumer receives the data it needs.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>2. What is the purpose of q.put(I)?</p>
                                    <p>
                                        The purpose of this method is to append the producer's output to the buffer (i.e. the queue).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>3. What is achieved by q.get()?</p>
                                    <p>
                                        This method's goal is to enable the user to get the product they need from the buffer (i.e. the queue).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>4. What functionality is provided by q.join()?</p>
                                    <p>
                                        join() method prevents the program from exiting until it receives a task_done signal from the consumer.
                                    </p>

									<h2>UNIT 4: EXPLORING PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CONCEPTS</h2>
                                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This week, we had the chance to learn more about the regex and recursion ideas. 
                                        Regex, is very helpful for when you need to check user input or look for specific 
                                        patterns in text. Also, there is a certain kind of regex termed "evil regex" that makes 
                                        the system hang for a very long time. From a security standpoint, it is especially crucial to 
                                        utilize good regex in order to avoid such vulnerabilities since attackers can execute ReDoS attacks by utilizing evil regex. I was able to use regrex during this unit also. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Check out the source code from <a href="https://github.com/AdamsUthman/Module3SSD-Codes/blob/main/postcodes.py">here</a>.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>PORTFOLIO COMPONENT: Programming language concepts</h3>
                                    <p><strong>1. What is ReDOS and what part do ‘Evil Regex’ play?</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack takes use of the fact that most Regular Expression implementations occasionally encounter extreme circumstances that make them operate slowly (exponentially related to input size). 
                                        When a program using a Regular Expression (Regex) encounters these unusual circumstances, an attacker can make the application hang for a very lengthy time.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>2. What are the common problems associated with the use of regex? How can these be mitigated?</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        One of the problems associated with using regrex is the <strong>incorreect use of wildcards</strong> Larson & Kirk (2018). When utilizing wildcards directly, individuals frequently take the short cuts without carefully considering what undesirable characters are included.
                                        By employing a variety of regex checker tools and educating programmers about potential regex mistakes and their effects, such errors can be reduced.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>3. How and why could regex be used as part of a security solution?</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        Regex is an extremely effective technique for validating user input, including passwords and other sensitive data. For instance, using username in the password can easily be blocked using regex. Therefore, 
                                        the programmer must take great care to prevent weaknesses in the regex in order to prevent potential assaults made with malicious regex.
                                    </p>

									<h2>UNIT 5: AN INTRODUCTION TO TESTING</h2>
                                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        It should come as no surprise that testing is among the most significant steps in the software development process. 
                                        There are many testing tools available in Python to test the source code, but creating test cases and using these tools effectively needs practice. 
                                        Despite the fact that the examples in the core book served as an introduction to Python's testing libraries, we now have the chance to explore how they may be applied in practice and perhaps even gain some first-hand experience.

                                    <h3>PORTFOLIO COMPONENT: Exploring the Cyclomatic Complexity’s Relevance Today</h3>
                                    <p><strong>The Cyclomatic Complexity is commonly considered in modules on testing the validity of code design today. However, in your opinion, should it be? Does it remain relevant today? Specific to the focus of this module, is it relevant in our quest to develop secure software? Justify all opinions which support your argument and share your responses with your team.</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) is still important today, in my opinion, at least in some parts. 
                                        The complexity of a source code should not, however, be determined exclusively by this metric; 
                                        rather, it should be used in conjunction with other metrics that consider the complexity of the individual branches and the complexity of the conditions themselves. 
                                        The mentioned factors may have a significant impact on the program's runtime because the quantity of decision points is only one component of complexity. Nonetheless, in my opinion, 
                                        CC still provides a general picture of the level of complexity, and a high CC may be a sign that the code needs to be refactored.

                                        It is crucial to appreciate the features of operating systems as well as to gain a deeper grasp of what is happening inside them because they are the most crucial piece of software in information systems. 
                                        This week, we had the chance to take a historical perspective to see how operating systems have changed over time. Furthermore, fundamental ideas like kernel, process, and threads were covered. 
                                        It is incredibly beneficial to go through these issues again in the context of secure software development.

                                    <p><strong>What is an Ontology?</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        ontology is a technical term defining an artifact that is developed for a goal, which is to enable the modeling of information about some domain, real or imaginary.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>Run the following command at the terminal prompt: http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/Ann. What happens when this command is run, and why?</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        The above command displays the information for the user “Ann”. The "get" method, which is written in the source code, prints the user information from the users dictionary to the screen because this is a "get" request.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>Run the following command at the terminal prompt: http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/Adam What happens when this command is run, and why?</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        The above command returns an error message: "User not found." This is a "get" request, and the get method searches the user dictionary for the parameter (Adam), but is unable to locate it there, returning this error.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>What capability is achieved by the flask library?</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        Flask is a microframework for developers that enables them to quickly and easily build and grow web projects.

                                        This week, we learned about the development of secure software architectures from a historical perspective. 
                                        I can better understand the power and benefits of Microservices now that I can see how designs have changed from the 1970s monolithic terminal server systems to the present, lightweight architectures. 
                                        The reading this week also aided in improving our comprehension of the advantages of virtualization, containers, and REST API, which we are also utilizing for our team project.
                                    </p>

                                        <li>Software is used in <strong>virtualization</strong> to imitate hardware features and build virtual computer systems.</li>
                                        <li>An electronic replica of a physical computer is called a <strong>virtual machine (VM)</strong>. Virtual machine software requires upkeep such as updates and system monitoring because it may run programs and operating systems, store data, connect to networks, and perform other computer operations.</li>
                                        <li>A system that hosts, provides, and manages the majority of the resources and services that the client requests is known as a <strong>client-server architecture</strong>. This approach, also known as the networking computing model or client server network, involves the delivery of all requests and services across a network.</li>
                                        <li>A software development technique known as <strong>service-oriented architecture (SOA)</strong> uses software elements called services to build business applications. Every service offers a particular business function, and services can converse with one another across platforms and languages.</li>
                                        <li><strong>REST API</strong>, which makes use of http features, is the most suitable messaging exchange mechanism for microservices. It relies on http protocol and includes the following methods:

                                        <li>Applications and services can operate side by side since the microkernel acts as a context-switching engine and merely offers isolation between the processes. In contrast to monolithic constructions, which have a vertical structure, this results in a horizontal structure.</li>
