                                    <h2>Unit 2 - A BLOG POST ON HOW PEOPLE CAN BE MANAGED TO OVERCOME CYBERSECURITY ATTACKS FROM THE INSIDE:</h2>
									<h4>Instruction</h4>
									<p>Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security. 
                                        Select five terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions and write a 300-word blog post on 
                                        how people can be managed to overcome cyber security attacks from the inside.
                                    </p>
									<h4>Answer</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        One of the top 10 vulnerabilities as identified by OWASP, is broken authentication (OWASP, 2021). A significant security risk might arise from improperly implemented authentication and session management calls. These flaws could make it simple for attackers to assume the identities of authorized users.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Due to users being careless with their passwords or using weak passwords, it makes it easier for hackers to get into their accounts and gain access to personal information. Enforcing strong password regulations and extra security measures, such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or one-time passwords (OTP), that ensure user compliance can help to reduce this.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        An activity diagram demonstrating how a hacker can access a user's account is provided below. Since there is no 2FA in place, the attacker has the freedom to attempt as many passwords as they like, beginning with a weaker one. It will be more difficult to log in with complex passwords, a restriction on the number of times an incorrect password can be entered, and 2FA in place.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The UK postcode system consists of a string that contains a number of characters and numbers – 
                                        a typical example is ST7 9HV (this is not valid
                                         – see below for why). The rules for the pattern are available from ideal postcodes (2020). Create a python program that implements a regex that complies with the rules provided – test it against the examples provided.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        At the beginig of the module we were divided into teams and tasked with developing an application
                                        that provides a secure repository for an organisation with domain-specific requirements. 
                                        The team decided to develop a secure repository for the <b>International Space Station (ISS)</b>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        As a result of the team effort, we came up with a project design document which 
                                        includes a brief introduction of the system that we will develop along with four UML diagrams.
                                    </p>
