                                    <p><b>Instruction</b></p>
                                    <p>As a Software Engineer, you are given the role of designing the software which supports the operation of a self-driving car. In your research around the capabilities of self-driving cars, you can search for keywords that include autonomous vehicle, driverless car, robotic car.
                                    You are required to identify three operations that you wish to support in your software and provision capability for them through the use of an object-oriented Python program. The system should support the ability for a customer to interact with the system through a front-end.
                                    Running in the system back-end should be a capability that simulates the generation and collection of data attributes that represent the wider environment within which the driverless car is operating.</p>
                                    <p><b>Evaluation</b></p>
                                    <p>This Assignment in particular was challenging and it pushed me to my limits. I had to implement all that I have learnt so far in the module.
                                    I have made a Car class that has an empty dictionary so that I may implement a nested dictionary within it. When I created the class, 
                                    I used the update() method to update the dictionary and add a nested dictionary to it. In order to avoid directly accessing the dictionary, I additionally created three getter functions for the keys(), values(), and items() procedures. Finally, I printed information saved in the dictionary to the screen using these getter functions.
                                    I began by deciding which three functions the software would support: traffic sign recognition, V2V communication, and obstacle detection, as indicated in the task description. I created the system so that every component could communicate with the vehicle's control unit, which would then assess the situation and take appropriate action (e.g. accelerate, brake, etc.).
                                    I came up with a design for a software to support a driverless car using UML, creating a use case diagram, an activity diagram, sequence diagrams, state transition diagrams, and lastly a class diagram.

                                    <p>
                                        I created the driverless vehicle in accordance with the design proposal I created in Unit 7. I have used the OOP technique for 
                                        the entire software. Most significantly, I created abstract base classes first, followed by classes, and then objects. Because there are numerous components in the system that communicate with one another, I transmitted the information by encapsulating it in objects (for instance, when an obstacle is detected, an obstacle object is created in the runtime and it is passed to the control unit of the car for processing).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I made some changes in addition to the classes, properties, and methods specified in the design document. Firstly, I updated the car log with a timestamp. Secondly, I removed the list signs() method from TMA DB because it is unnecessary given the current structure (e.g. there is no direct benefit for user to list the signs in the database). Additionally, Methods for changing lanes and changing directions were added.
                                    </p>
