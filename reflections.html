									<p>The aim of the module on object-oriented information systems is to critically assess the ideas and tenets of information systems and to create an object-oriented information system architecture using functional programming languages. As someone whose first degree was in mechanical engineering, I do not have a strong foundation in computer science. 
										I hoped that this program would provide me a better understanding of system design. This was one of my most challenging modules to date since I learnt about object-oriented programming along with the methods used to implement it. Despite having prior understanding of its fundamentals, I have not had the opportunity to implement it in any project. 
										Unit by unit, the education method gradually but certainly gave me a deeper understanding of the principles and techniques of object-oriented programming. Furthermore, we were introduced to the steps involved in the software development cycle, such as planning, requirement analysis, and design. During this module, I got to understand that the design phase as well as testing the system were both key aspects of the development cycle. 
										In contrast to the reading section of the courses, the seminars and activities from the units were more helpful to my understanding of the topic.  </p>
									<p>During the module, I discovered that the object-oriented approach is a potent idea related to reality rather than employing functions and logic. Additionally, I got to understand the various concepts of object-oriented programming like polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation and inheritance(Hardy, 2021).  
										I tried applying these concepts in my projects, but I was finding it extremely difficult to create objects that communicate each other, group attributes and methods into a class, and understand the use of abstract base classes. 
										However, after carefully going over the codio activities, investing time in developing my skills through coding exercises, and working particularly on the system implementation of a driverless car, I progressively changed my perspective such that I could consider the components of programs as actual things.</p>
									<p>
										The Unified Modelling Language (UML), which aids engineers in drawing diagrams of software functionality before it is turned into code, was the next software design idea I was introduced to. Standard UML diagrams facilitate communication with developers and aid in understanding the software system architecture at various stages of the software development life cycle (Ahmad et al., 2019). 
										To apply these diagrams in my project, I found it difficult to properly design them. For instance, creating the class diagram for the driverless car was difficult for me because of the numerous links between the classes. The complexity of the development increases with the number of classes. Additionally, when creating the driverless car system, I had to make changes to the classes and methods I had anticipated before implementation.
									</p>
									<p>
										I was also able to increase my knowledge on the importance of doing tests at various stages of development after learning about the various testing levels such as unit tests, exploratory test, integration tests, and functional tests. For instance, as part of the system implementation assignment, I ran unit tests after completing the development of some components to ensure that it performs as intended. After developing various components, I used integration testing to see if they integrated well with one another. 
										Finally, I used functional and exploratory tests to see how well each component worked as a whole. One of Python's most potent characteristics is its array of automated testing tools and libraries (Arbuckle, 2010). I had the opportunity to utilize Pylint (Pylint, N.D.) a few times while working on my project, and I found it to be helpful.
									</p>
									<p>
										My e-portfolio was due as the final project for this module. I must admit that it takes a lot of time to write about what I have learnt and how. However, I have started to appreciate and comprehend the significance of the e-portfolio process after exerting effort and devoting myself to it. My e-framework portfolio's being set up from the first module, all I need to do is edit the pages for each course and submit the projects for that units. 
										All things considered, the e-portfolio helps students gain priceless experience through careful reflection on their educational journey, keep track of their progress, reaffirm their commitment to education, improve peer collaboration through feedback, monitor their personal growth, and accomplish several other tasks.
									</p>
									<p>
										I will undoubtedly use what I learnt in this lesson in my future projects now that I am aware of the importance of the design process and, more particularly, UML diagrams. I am also aware that I should not be too fixed in my ways and should be ready to adapt my initial plan if necessary while it is being implemented. It turns out that it can be challenging to strike a balance between upholding the original idea and being flexible enough to make required adjustments to it. 
										I also need to learn more about current code and design patterns in order to write object-oriented software with more ease and effectiveness. Additionally, I need to focus more on the practice phase of the learning process as it is the best approach to enhance learning results. 
										For my system implementation assignment, there were sadly not enough design pattern implementation tasks in this module. My goal will be to keep putting all that I have learnt into practice to become comfortable applying the concepts of OOP, testing and using UML diagrams in my future project.
