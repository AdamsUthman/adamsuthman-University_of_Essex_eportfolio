                        <h3>Team Members</h3>
                        <ul>
							<li>Uthman Adams</li>
							<li>Trevor Woodman</li>
							<li>Dheeran Calder</li>
							<li>Daud Ahmed</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Notes from meeting</h3>
						<p>In our first meeting, we had to agree and draft a team contract.
							During this meeting, we agreed on the terms of the contract and selected Trevor Woodman as our leader. We also created a Github repository and created a group chat on teams to be in constant communication throughout the module.
							We also decided to each brainstorm on what domain we shoul work on before the next meeting. 

						</p>
						<p>Check out the contract <a href="pdf/SSDCS-PCOM7E-TeamTransparency-TeamContract-FINAL.pdf">here</a>.</p>

						<h3>Notes from meeting</h3>
						<p>
							During this meeting, we had to decide on the project we will be working on and the direction we will take in achieving the goal.
							Before the meeting I already had some ideas on the type of the domain we should work on and created a draft of what it would like.
							Everybody presented their ideas and after listening we decided to go with Trevor's idea which was create a  secure repository for data transmitted from the ISS (International Space Station) to ground stations owned and operated by members of the ISS programme.
							I decided that we should go with the name IDA(ISS Data Archive) which everyone agreed to. Also, we created a draft for the design documentation consisting of the project specifications.
						</p>

						<h3>Notes from meeting</h3>
						<p>
							During this meeting, we decided to focus on the UML diagrams first as it will help us develop the code faster and easily. We shared the roles amongst ourselves and we were to come with the diagrams in the next meeting. 

						</p>

						<h3>Notes from meeting</h3>
						<p>
							I was tasked with drawing the UML diagrams which I did. During this meeting I presented the diagrams and there were some few adjustments to it. Dheeran who was tasked with the class diagram also presented them and we added a few things and updated the design document.

						</p>

						<h3>Notes from meeting</h3>
						<p>
							This was the last meeting before the submission of the design proposal. We updated the design document with more specifications, the UML diagrams and class diagram before submitting the document.
						</p>

						<h3>Notes from meeting</h3>
						<p>
							Since we submitted the design document in unit 6 it was time to move foward with the project.
							We looked into different frameworks to use for the development of the code. We decided to go with bottle to handle the CRUD process of all the data being transmitted.
							The team leader assigned various roles to each of us, someone working on the frontend, someone working on the database and finally someone working on the backend.
						</p>

						<h3>Notes from meeting</h3>
						<p>
							Moving foward, we realized that bottle was built on another framework flask, a mistake we should not be making. We also decided to store the data in a SQLite database and enabled communication with it via a bespoke API written using flask. 
							The task and objectives that needed to be achieved were in the repo under todo enabling us to keep track of what needs to be done and what has been done.
						</p>
						<h3>Notes from meeting</h3>
						<p>
							During this meeting, we decided to do a walkthrough of the project and how far we had come. I was tasked with designing the frontend together with Trevor, it consisted of a handful of interfaces: home, longin, records, users, and logs. 
							The other team members worked on the backend and database. At this time we were already close to finishing up and we just needed to update the design document and apply some finishing touches. 
						
						</p>

						<h3>Notes from meeting</h3>
						<p>
							This was the last meeting before the final submission, we worked on the README files explaining how the app should be run and also updating the design document before submitting the finished work.				
						</p>

						<h3>*Disclaimer*</h3>
						<p><strong>
							Due to the difference in timezone and other issues we couldn't hold a lot of virtual meetings rather we talked more often through the group created on teams.
						</strong></p>
