									<p>The aim of the module on object-oriented information systems is to critically assess the ideas and tenets of information systems and to create an object-oriented information system architecture using functional programming languages. As someone whose first degree was in mechanical engineering, I do not have a strong foundation in computer science. 
										I hoped that this program would provide me a better understanding of system design. This was one of my most challenging modules to date since I learnt about object-oriented programming along with the methods used to implement it. Despite having prior understanding of its fundamentals, I have not had the opportunity to implement it in any project. 
										Unit by unit, the education method gradually but certainly gave me a deeper understanding of the principles and techniques of object-oriented programming. Furthermore, we were introduced to the steps involved in the software development cycle, such as planning, requirement analysis, and design. During this module, I got to understand that the design phase as well as testing the system were both key aspects of the development cycle. 
										In contrast to the reading section of the courses, the seminars and activities from the units were more helpful to my understanding of the topic. </p>
									<p>During the module, I discovered that the object-oriented approach is a potent idea related to reality rather than employing functions and logic. Additionally, I got to understand the various concepts of object-oriented programming like abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation (Hardy, 2021).  
										I tried applying these concepts in my projects, but I was finding it extremely difficult to group the attributes and methods into a class, create multiple objects, make them communicate with one another, and understand the value of abstract base classes, interfaces, and getter/setter methods. 
										However, after carefully going over the codio activities, investing countless hours in coding exercises, and working particularly on the system implementation, which involved creating software for a driverless car that was made up of numerous components (objects) that interacted with one another, I gradually developed a new mindset that allowed me to think of the parts of programs as objects in real life.</p>
									<p>
										The Unified Modelling Language (UML), which aids engineers in drawing diagrams of software functionality before it is turned into code, was the next software design idea I was introduced to. 
										At various phases of the software development life cycle, it is simpler to communicate with developers and get an overview of the software system architecture thanks to the standard UML diagrams (Ahmad et al., 2019). 
										To apply these diagrams in my project, I found it difficult to properly design them. For instance, the several relationships between the classes made it challenging for me to construct the class diagram for the driverless car. 
										The more the classes, the more complicated the development becomes. Additionally, I had to modify the classes and methods I had anticipated before implementation when I was developing the driverless car system.
									</p>
									<p>
										I was also able to increase my knowledge on the importance of doing tests at various stages of development after learning about the various testing levels such as unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and exploratory tests. 
										For instance, as part of the system implementation assignment, I ran unit tests after completing the development of some components to ensure that it performs as intended. After developing various components, I used integration testing to see if they integrated well with one another. 
										Finally, I used functional and exploratory tests to see how well each component worked as a whole. One of Python's most potent characteristics is its array of automated testing tools and libraries (Arbuckle, 2010). While working on my project, I got the chance to use Pylint (Pylint, N.D.) a few times, and I thought it was useful.
									</p>
									<p>
										My e-portfolio was due as the final project for this module. I must admit that it takes a lot of time to write about what I have learnt and how. However, after putting up effort and dedicating myself to my e-portfolio, I have started to understand and value the importance of the e-portfolio process. 
										I am happy that I started working on my e-portfolio in the first module. My e-framework portfolio's being set up, all I need to do is edit the pages for each course and submit the projects for that units. 
										Overall, the e-portfolio aids students in tracking their progress, fostering better peer collaboration through feedback, gaining priceless experience through thoughtful reflection on their educational journey, reaffirming their commitment to education, tracking their personal growth, and many other tasks.
									</p>
									<p>
										I will undoubtedly use what I learnt in this lesson in my future projects now that I am aware of the importance of the design process and, more particularly, UML diagrams. I am also aware that I should not be too fixed in my ways and should be ready to adapt my initial plan if necessary while it is being implemented. 
										It turns out that striking a balance between adhering to the original concept and being adaptable to make necessary changes to it is difficult. To feel more comfortable and effective when writing an object-oriented software, I also need to understand more about existing code and design patterns. 
										Additionally, since learning by doing is the greatest way to improve learning outcomes, I need to concentrate more on the practice portion of the learning process. For my system implementation assignment, there were sadly not enough design pattern implementation tasks in this module. 
										My goal will be to keep putting all that I have learnt into practice to become comfortable applying the concepts of OOP, testing and using UML diagrams in my future project.
