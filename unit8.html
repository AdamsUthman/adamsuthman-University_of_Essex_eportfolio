										<h1>UNIT 8: DATA STRUCTURES AND DATA SEARCH IN PRACTICE</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h2 id="content"></h2>
									<p> The purpose of this unit is to comprehend which data structure methods are applicable in a driverless car. 
                                        Additionally, a group discussion is held in this unit concerning the advantages and disadvantages of developing a metamodel to assist object-oriented design for the Internet of Things. 
                                        The Polymorphism course will also be the next step in developing your object-object programming skills. 
                                        The session "Errors and Data Structure" will also include a linear search on a list data structure and managing exceptions.</p>
                                    <p>I completed the Recursion and Polymorphism modules in this week's Code module. Recursion always requires careful consideration, and if used incorrectly, 
                                        things could become difficult very quickly. Here, the general guideline is to begin with the most likely scenario. 
                                        On the other hand, all forms of polymorphism were covered in the exercises in the polymorphism module, and it was a useful practice.</p>	
									<h2>FORUM DISCUSSION</h2>			
									<p><b>Instruction</b></p>
									<p>Making reference to the article by Fortino et al. (2015), consider the strengths and weaknesses of designing a metamodel to support object-oriented design of the IoT. 
										Design a smart model equivalent to that presented in Figure 6 which would instead support operation of a driverless car.</p>
									<p><b>Answer</b></p>
									<p>
										Internet of things (IoT) refers to a physical object that has an internet coneection, e.g a tracker, motion sensor. Additionally, object-oriented programming refers to imitating real life objects in computer programs. This makes OOP the perfect approach in developing programs for IoT devices.
										One of the major strengths of the  metamodel approach is that it aids in identifying how smart objects interact with gadgets and services (Fortino et al., 2015). Additionally, it exhorts programmers to concentrate on the design elements and decide upon them before to the start of the implementation and development process. 
										Finally, these metamodels increase the models' reusability by serving as a blueprint for systems that would be created in the future.
										Unfortunately, this approach has it's weaknesses and onr of them is that in terms of flaws, I believe the metamodel approach shares many of the same issues as the Unified Modeling Language (UML).  For instance, a significant challenge is the absence of "formal semantics." 
										It can be difficult to follow the metamodel approach because it takes a lot of time, especially for projects that must be completed quickly. As a result, convincing project owners and developers to invest time in the design phase may also prove challenging.

									<h2>SKILLS/KNOWLEDGE GAINED</h2>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-15 col-15-small">
												<ul>
													<li>I learnt about the two test frameworks in python: namely Pytest and Nose.</li>
                                                    <li>I also learnt that global variable modification is not recommended. An independent function that accepts parameters and returns a value might be created instead.</li>
	                                                <li>I learnt about UNITEST which is the name of the built-in test library provided by Python for unit tests. It offers a class called TestCase. A subclass of TestCase should be built and testing methods should be written when designing a test. The word "test" should be the first word in method names. The number of test methods that can be written in a test case is unlimited. </li>
												</ul>
