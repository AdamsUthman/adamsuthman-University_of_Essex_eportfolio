									<h2>Unit 1 - AN INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON PROGRAMMING AND THE OO PROGRAMMING PARADIGM</h2>
                                    <h3>My Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This unit's major objective was to compare agile techniques with a security focus on the Waterfall method. 
                                        These two methods adopt quite distinct postures in terms of security, documentation, and development speed. 
                                        With several concepts like S-Scrum (Mougouei, et al., 2013) or Secure Scrum, researchers have been seeking 
                                        to address the security gap while agile methodologies, particularly Scrum, appear to be disregarding it (Pohl & Hof, 2015). 
                                        Scrum is a reasonably well-known software development framework, therefore analyzing its security strategy is particularly relevant to the module and, generally, to the state of software development today.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The team also met during this unit and we had our first group meeting. We agreed on a team contract, and also set up a GitHub repository for the project.
                                        Being part of a remote development team will, in my opinion, be a thrilling experience given how popular remote working is today. It will also help me work on my communication skills.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Forum Discussion</h3>
                                    <p>Select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One of the top 10 vulnerabilities as identified by OWASP, is broken authentication (OWASP, 2021). A significant security risk might arise from improperly implemented authentication and session management calls. These flaws could make it simple for attackers to assume the identities of authorized users.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Due to users being careless with their passwords or using weak passwords, it makes it easier for hackers to get into their accounts and gain access to personal information. Enforcing strong password regulations and extra security measures, such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or one-time passwords (OTP), that ensure user compliance can help to reduce this.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        An activity diagram demonstrating how a hacker can access a user's account is provided below. Since there is no 2FA in place, the attacker has the freedom to attempt as many passwords as they like, beginning with a weaker one. It will be more difficult to log in with complex passwords, a restriction on the number of times an incorrect password can be entered, and 2FA in place.
                                    </p>

                                        <li>Scrum, pair programming, the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), and test-driven development are all components of the <strong>Agile Approach</strong> to software development. This method makes it simple to return to the software's earlier stage(s) if necessary.</li>
                                        <li>The <strong>Waterfall model </strong>is a step-by-step process where each phase is dependent on the results of the one before it. The cost of going back to an earlier phase of the project is high. As a result, it is unable to adapt to changing needs.</li>
                                        <li>Scrum prioritizes fast software development and deployment over a proper security perspective by design. Scrum's weakness can be reduced by risky solutions like <strong>S-Scrum or Secure Scrum</strong>.</li>
                                        <li>The general structure of a software system and the relationships between its components are more the focus of<strong> Architecture</strong>.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Testability</strong> is the scope of the ease/difficulty with which a system or software artifact can be tested.</li>

                                    <p>
                                        The main topic of conversation this week was various cyber security issues. 
                                        We continued our collaborative conversation regarding the OWASP's Top 10 security concerns, 
                                        and everyone agreed that the biggest security risk we currently face comes from people's negligence. 
                                        Many consumers appear to be completely unaware of the need of choosing a strong password, protecting their login information, 
                                        and adhering to fundamental security guidelines. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Skills/Knowledge Gained</h3>

                                        <li>Because there are currently no Security Engineering processes established expressly for agile techniques, businesses must rely on SE processes created for the waterfall approach.</li>
                                        <li>It's crucial to think about the effects of applying the patch before installing the updates (e.g. downtime, effected components, etc.).</li>
                                        <li>The risk for program users grows when the individual or people who discover the issue distribute the exploit code publicly.</li>

                                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        While we read extensively and learned a lot about design patterns in the prior module, 
                                        this week's reading regarding the application of design patterns in Python was extremely intriguing and helpful. 
                                        Having a clear understanding of how things should be done helped me immensely because I plan to implement some pertinent design patterns into my future coding efforts. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We had two code-related activities this week. One of them gave an example of the memory management differences between C and Python. The producer-consumer mechanism was second one that was looked into.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>TEAM ACTIVITY: DISCUSSION</h3>
                                    <p><Strong>Question: What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</Strong></p>
                                    <p><Strong>Ans: </Strong> The three main programming language vulnerabilities, according to Cifuentes & Bierman (2019),
                                         are buffer errors, injection mistakes, and information leak flaws. No programming language is immune to all three of these errors, 
                                         as they showed in their research, hence there is no such thing as a "secure language."
                                    </p>
                                    <p><Strong>Question: Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</Strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Ans:</strong>
                                        Although having some more elegant memory management features than certain other languages, 
                                        Python is nonetheless prone to several security flaws, such as overflow issues and injection 
                                        attacks (especially in the case of web frameworks). As a result, Python cannot be regarded as a secure language.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><Strong>Question:  Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</Strong></p>
                                    <p><strong>Ans:</strong>
                                        Python is a fantastic language that can be used for a number of reasons since it is a high-level language, 
                                        making it simpler to code. It also has substantial library support. It is slower, though, because it is an interpreted language. 
                                        Contrarily, C is a compiled language that gives greater flexibility in addition to being faster. It would be more appropriate to 
                                        design an operating system based on how it handles memory. C is therefore a superior language to use for developing an operating system.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>CODIO ACTIVITIES</h3>
                                    <p><strong>Exploring Python tools and features</strong></p>
                                    <p>Buffer overflow in C and Python:</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Buffer overflow in C: Using "char buf[8]," only a memory space for 8 characters was allocated in the RAM for user input. 
                                        So, we receive a "core dumped" error when a user enters an input with more than 8 characters.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>The Producer-Consumer Mechanism</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        1. How is the queue data structure used to achieve the purpose of the code?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The producer appends the data it creates to the queue data structure, which serves as a buffer where the consumer receives the data it needs.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>2. What is the purpose of q.put(I)?</p>
                                    <p>
                                        The purpose of this method is to append the producer's output to the buffer (i.e. the queue).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>3. What is achieved by q.get()?</p>
                                    <p>
                                        This method's goal is to enable the user to get the product they need from the buffer (i.e. the queue).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>4. What functionality is provided by q.join()?</p>
                                    <p>
                                        join() method prevents the program from exiting until it receives a task_done signal from the consumer.
                                    </p>

									<h2>UNIT 4: EXPLORING PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CONCEPTS</h2>
                                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This week, we had the chance to learn more about the regex and recursion ideas. 
                                        Regex, is very helpful for when you need to check user input or look for specific 
                                        patterns in text. Also, there is a certain kind of regex termed "evil regex" that makes 
                                        the system hang for a very long time. From a security standpoint, it is especially crucial to 
                                        utilize good regex in order to avoid such vulnerabilities since attackers can execute ReDoS attacks by utilizing evil regex. I was able to use regrex during this unit also. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Check out the source code from <a href="https://github.com/AdamsUthman/Module3SSD-Codes/blob/main/postcodes.py">here</a>.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3>PORTFOLIO COMPONENT: Programming language concepts</h3>
                                    <p><strong>1. What is ReDOS and what part do ‘Evil Regex’ play?</strong></p>

                                        The Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack takes use of the fact that most Regular Expression implementations occasionally encounter extreme circumstances that make them operate slowly (exponentially related to input size). 
                                        When a program using a Regular Expression (Regex) encounters these unusual circumstances, an attacker can make the application hang for a very lengthy time.

                                    <p><strong>2. What are the common problems associated with the use of regex? How can these be mitigated?</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        One of the problems associated with using regrex is the <strong>incorreect use of wildcards</strong> Larson & Kirk (2018). When utilizing wildcards directly, individuals frequently take the short cuts without carefully considering what undesirable characters are included.
                                        By employing a variety of regex checker tools and educating programmers about potential regex mistakes and their effects, such errors can be reduced.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>3. How and why could regex be used as part of a security solution?</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        Regex is an extremely effective technique for validating user input, including passwords and other sensitive data. For instance, using username in the password can easily be blocked using regex. Therefore, 
                                        the programmer must take great care to prevent weaknesses in the regex in order to prevent potential assaults made with malicious regex.
                                    </p>

									<h2>UNIT 5: AN INTRODUCTION TO TESTING</h2>

                                    <p>
                                        It should come as no surprise that testing is among the most significant steps in the software development process. 
                                        There are many testing tools available in Python to test the source code, but creating test cases and using these tools effectively needs practice. 
                                        Despite the fact that the examples in the core book served as an introduction to Python's testing libraries, we now have the chance to explore how they may be applied in practice and perhaps even gain some first-hand experience. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>PORTFOLIO COMPONENT: Exploring the Cyclomatic Complexity’s Relevance Today</h3>
                                    <p><strong>The Cyclomatic Complexity is commonly considered in modules on testing the validity of code design today. However, in your opinion, should it be? Does it remain relevant today? Specific to the focus of this module, is it relevant in our quest to develop secure software? Justify all opinions which support your argument and share your responses with your team.</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) is still important today, in my opinion, at least in some parts. 
                                        The complexity of a source code should not, however, be determined exclusively by this metric; 
                                        rather, it should be used in conjunction with other metrics that consider the complexity of the individual branches and the complexity of the conditions themselves. 
                                        The mentioned factors may have a significant impact on the program's runtime because the quantity of decision points is only one component of complexity. Nonetheless, in my opinion, 
                                        CC still provides a general picture of the level of complexity, and a high CC may be a sign that the code needs to be refactored.

                                    <p>
                                        We had the opportunity to investigate the many types of architectures and their advantages and disadvantages in this unit. 
                                        I found it particularly fascinating how microservices were applied to the prediction of infectious diseases in a real-world setting. This course was really helpful in helping me to comprehend the goal of ontologies and how to create one. 
                                    </p>

                                    <ul>

                                                <li>SOA RA (supports the achievement of SOA)</li>
                                                <li>OSIMM (facilitates incremental adoption of SOA)</li>

                                        <li><strong>Active attacks</strong> involve the attacker changing the data being transmitted while it is being transmitted or fabricating transmissions.</li>
                                        <li>In <strong>passive attacks</strong>, the user merely keeps an eye on things, sniffs the network, and keeps an eye on the data being sent.</li>
                                        <li>Monolithic architectures are difficult to scale and use, especially when there is a distributed workforce, but they are typically faster because they all share a common memory and are located in the same location.</li>
                                        <li>Web services are published in the Web Services Directory by Web Services Providers in Service-Oriented Architecture so that Web Services Clients can find and use them.</li>

									<h2>UNIT 11: FUTURE TRENDS IN SECURE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        We had the chance to have a look at upcoming developments in software development in this unit, with a focus on the shift from monolithic structures to microservices. 
                                        The reading material gave readers a historical perspective on how structures have changed over time. I found it very fascinating to learn about ideas like mobile edge computing and fog computing. 
                                        Since there was not much reading required for this unit, the assignment submission was the most exciting aspect of this week. As a team, we were able to finish our project and submit it on time. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Team Activity</h3>
                                    <p><strong>Debate: Microservices and Microkernels</strong></p>
                                    <p>Read Appendix A: the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate in DiBona & Ockman (1999) then read Fritzsch et al (2019).

                                        The forum has a message that says: “Torvalds has been proven wrong and it only took nearly thirty years. Microservices and microkernels are the future. “
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <h3>Skills/Knowledge Gained</h3>			                                    
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>In a decentralized computing environment known as <strong>fog computing</strong>, data, compute, storage, and applications are distributed between the data source and the cloud.</li>
                                        <li>A sort of network architecture called <strong>multi-access edge computing (MEC)</strong> offers cloud computing capabilities and an IT service environment at the network's edge.</li>
                                        <li>While <strong>cloud computing</strong> enables us to store and manage our data and information, <strong>mobile computing</strong> allows us to access data and information via a mobile device.</li>
                                        <li>A collection of virtualization platforms with a variety of capabilities makes up the <strong>superfluid cloud</strong>.</li>
                                        <li>Latency of security mechanisms is the biggest challenge to secure the edge paradigms.</li>

                                        The distinctions between monolithic architectures and microkernels 
                                        were examined in further detail. According to Biggs et al. (2018), the privileged code base is lower in the case of microkernels, decreasing the attack surface. Speed is one of the benefits provided by monolithic kernels, however there are others as well. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>We had to write a reflection on the module since this was the last unit in the course. This offered me the chance to reflect on my development during this module and the entire course.
                                        I was able to hone my existing abilities and learn new ones, like how to develop an API from scratch, work well in a team, and communicate effectively.

                                        <li>The TCB's privileged code has the ability to get beyond security measures.</li>
                                        <li>The amount of code running in privileged mode is minimized by the microkernel. The least privilege principle is the foundation of the microkernel design.</li>
                                        <li>Applications and services can operate side by side since the microkernel acts as a context-switching engine and merely offers isolation between the processes. In contrast to monolithic constructions, which have a vertical structure, this results in a horizontal structure.</li>
